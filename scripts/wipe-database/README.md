# Wiping database script

This folder contains a script used for wiping the `topics` database in mongodb.

Needs to have mongodb 4.4+ installed and running - this can be done via the dp-compose repository.

These scripts expect to be run from the root directory of this repo - there are make commands to do this:

```sh
    make database-wipe
```
